# Test Markdown Rendering

This is a test file to verify our markdown improvements.

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- First item
- Second item  
- Third item

### Ordered Lists
1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

## Text Formatting

**Bold text** should be rendered in bold.
*Italic text* should be rendered in italics.
`Inline code` should have background highlighting.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote
> It should be styled differently
> With proper indentation

## Code Blocks

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let x = 42;
}
```

```
Plain code block without syntax highlighting
Should still have proper background
```

## Mixed Content

Here's a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text, plus `inline code`.

- List item with **bold text**
- List item with *italic text*  
- List item with `inline code`

> Blockquote with **bold** and *italic* formatting
